p(d). Represents a abstract NxActor class; Actors, SceneGeometries, KinematicActors, Volumes and classes that inherit from
these are all RigidBodies. All raycasting, sweeping, and other testing functions refer to NxActors as RigidBodies.

To differentiate between RigidBodies (to re-cast them), use the RigidBody::getType() function, which returns a specific
class code. User classes may also use this coding system to help differentiating between their classes and NxOgre's.
